Hello Shahab,

You just need to click the run button in Eclipse or use command “java Run” after compiled all java files, and it will create Outputs folder and generate all the txt files automatically. My program needs a blank line at the bottom of every dataset, just like g++ compiler does. So I attached the datasets for you in order to save your time.

Thank you so much,
Kuilin.
